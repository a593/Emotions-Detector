<b>Emotion detection using deep learning</b>

<b>Introduction</b>

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

<b>Dependencies</b>

Python 3, OpenCV, Tensorflow
To install the required packages, run pip install -r requirements.txt.

<b>To use this model in your system---</b>

1.Copy the code of opencv.ipynv and open it on Jupyter Notebooks

2.After that import required libraries (if not installed then must intall them)

3.Download model.h5 file in system and give model.h5 file location 

4.Then just run the cells and webcam wil open and you can predict the emotions.

5.Model.h5 file has all the weights,biases after training of the model, you can directly use it.

<b>Note</b>- To quit the webcam after prediction Just press 'Q'
